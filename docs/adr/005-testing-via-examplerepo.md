# 5. Testing via example-repository

Date 7. February 2019

## Status:

proposed

## Context:

"ghost" should be tested thoroughly. The tests must fit the real git-behaviour.

## Decision:

The app will be tested on a real repositories. These repos will be made to fit certain testcases.

## Consequences:

With this, the testing should be close to a real-world-case. The example repos will serve as customized real-life-cases, thus making testing without mocks a bit easier. Still, tests must then be supplemented by a fitting repository.
